								<b>About Me:</b>
								<br> Welcome! my name is Max Fine(he/him) I am an energetic 4th year student specialising in Physics & Astrophysics (ðŸ“¡ðŸ’«) at the University of Toronto. 

<br><br> The idea of exploring the unknown, improving our understanding of the cosmos, and simultaneously adding to the collective knowledge of humankind is described by many as a noble cause â€“ I want to do this because this is what I live for. I believe that governments, private corporations, and others may sponsor such endeavors for reasons that are not altruistic in nature, but scientists find the idea of discovery, and improving our understanding of the cosmos as the ultimate reason for their careers. This is what I do for fun and would not rather do anything else. 

<br><br> My dream is to live the adventurous life of a scientific researcher. With regards to my career, I would like to earn a PHD related to astrophysics and become a research professor.  As of now, I am uncertain which subject I want to study in graduate school; as all astrophysics is incredibly stimulating, itâ€™s hard to narrow down my interest. Along the way, I would like to serve in the Peace Corps (teaching high school math and science for 2 years abroad), study for an extended period of time in Australia, Europe and be on at least one Antarctic research mission.
