								<b>About Me:</b>
								<br> Greetings and well wishes to all who may encounter this message! My name is Max Fine (he/him) I am an energetic senior undergraduate student specialising in Physics & Astrophysics (üì°üí´) at the University of Toronto.

<br><br> The idea of exploring the unknown, improving our understanding of the cosmos, and simultaneously adding to the collective knowledge of humankind is described by many as a noble cause ‚Äì I want to do this because this is what I live for. I believe that governments, private corporations, and others may sponsor such endeavors for reasons that are not altruistic in nature, but scientists find the idea of discovery, and improving our understanding of the cosmos as the ultimate reason for their careers. This is what I do for fun and would not rather do anything else.

<br><br> My dream is to live the adventurous life of a scientific researcher. With regards to my career, I would like to earn a PhD related to astrophysics and become a research professor.  As of now, I am uncertain which subject I want to study in graduate school; as all astrophysics is incredibly stimulating, it‚Äôs hard to narrow down my interest. Along the way, I would like to serve in the Peace Corps (teaching high school math and science for 2 years abroad), study for an extended period of time in Australia, Europe and be on at least one Antarctic research mission.

																														<b> Project Abstract: </b>The origin of Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) remains a mystery even as we are collecting important signs that point towards preferred source models. A key piece of the puzzle is the search for their multiwavelength counterparts. The detection of a FRB-like event from the Galactic magnetar SGR 1935+2154 with a simultaneous X-ray burst points to a magnetar origin for some FRBs, and such magnetar high-energy bursts may be detectable from nearby FRB sources. I will present the results of three different studies probing for high-energy counterparts of FRBs in complementary ways: Deep limits from XMM, Chandra, and NICER at the time of CHIME radio bursts from the most nearby FRB source, FRB 20200120E, located in a M81 globular cluster; deep CHIME+NICER observations of the most active FRB source, FRB 20220912A; and limits from Swift BAT GUANO on prompt gamma-ray counterparts at the time of hundreds of FRBs detected by CHIME. I will then discuss what these three and other high-energy limits can tell us about the nature of FRBs.

In order to test this, I implemented simplistic emission waveforms, using parameters based on the known magnetar giant flares. I then used these waveforms to estimate the signal-to-noise ratio for third generation detectors. My resulting highest signal-to-noise was $\sim 10^{-3}$ which is four orders of magnitude smaller then my detection threshold of 8, indicating that third generation detectors will be unable to detect magnetar giant flares.

																														<b> Project Description: </b>
																														The "Polarization Sky Survey of the Universe's
Magnetism" (POSSUM) is one of the eight major
surveys to be conducted by the Australian Square
Kilometer Array Pathfinder (ASKAP). POSSUM will
make a catalogue of Faraday rotation measures (RMs)
for around a million extragalactic radio sources ‚Äì that's
an increase of 20x the current known Faraday rotation
measures (RMs). The goal of this project was to
develop a robust error analysis of the POSSUM data as
a part of the POSSUM data pipeline. <br>The key result from this project was the discovery that
the output error bars from the pipeline are slightly
too small. If the error bars were the correct size, then
in the histogram below would match the Gaussian
distribution exactly. However, the normalized residual
is too wide for the Gaussian - this means the error
bars are too small. Having too small error bars for the
pipeline is a concern as future research will depend
on the accuracy of the errors. 	<br><br> <a href="files/robust_error_analysis.pptx" target="_blank"> POSSUM Presentation</a><p>

																								2022, submitted. <br> <br> <b> Project Abstract:</b> Measurements of the polarization of radio emission are subject to a number of depolarization effects such as bandwidth
depolarization, which is caused by the averaging effect of a finite channel bandwidth combined with the frequency-dependent
polarization caused by Faraday rotation. There have been very few mathematical treatments of bandwidth depolarization,
especially in the context of the rotation measure (RM) synthesis method for analyzing radio polarization data. We have found a
simple equation for predicting if bandwidth depolarization is significant for a given observational configuration. We have derived
and tested three methods of modifying RM synthesis to correct for bandwidth depolarization. From these tests we have developed
a new algorithm that can detect bandwidth-depolarized signals with higher signal-to-noise than conventional RM synthesis and
recover the correct source polarization properties (RM and polarized intensity). We have verified that this algorithm works as
expected with real data from the LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey. To make this algorithm available to the community, we have
added it as a new tool in the RM-Tools polarization analysis package. <br> <br>  <a href="files/rm_tools_poster.pdf" target="_blank"> End of SURP Poster</a><p>
