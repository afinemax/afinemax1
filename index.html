								<b>About Me:</b>
								<br> Greetings and well wishes to all who may encounter this message! My name is Max Fine (he/him) I am an energetic undergraduate student specialising in Physics & Astrophysics (üì°üí´) at the University of Toronto.



<br><br> The idea of exploring the unknown, improving our understanding of the cosmos, and simultaneously adding to the collective knowledge of humankind is described by many as a noble cause ‚Äì I want to do this because this is what I live for. I believe that governments, private corporations, and others may sponsor such endeavors for reasons that are not altruistic in nature, but scientists find the idea of discovery, and improving our understanding of the cosmos as the ultimate reason for their careers. This is what I do for fun and would not rather do anything else.

<br><br> When I'm not studying, you can often find me exploring Toronto's cafes and searching for the perfect latte. I also care deeply about science advocacy and believe that it's essential to share the wonder and importance of science with the broader community.

<br><br> My dream is to live the adventurous life of a scientific researcher. With regards to my career, I would like to earn a PhD related to astrophysics and become a research professor.  As of now, I am uncertain which subject I want to study in graduate school; as all astrophysics is incredibly stimulating, it‚Äôs hard to narrow down my interest. Along the way, I would like to serve in the Peace Corps (teaching high school math and science for 2 years abroad), study for an extended period of time in Australia, Europe and be on at least one Antarctic research mission.

																														<b> Project Abstract: </b>	<br> Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are brief radio pulses with unknown extragalactic origins. So far FRBs
																																	have only been detected at radio frequencies. Several FRB progenitor models propose that these bursts
																																	originate from magnetars, and predict associated Œ≥-ray emission. Previous Œ≥-ray searches have only
																																	examined two repeating FRB sources. This study used data from the Swift/BAT telescope which
																																	was obtained with GUANO to analyze 380 CHIME/FRB targets. I made an analysis pipeline that
																																	estimates the peak Signal-To-Noise Ratio (S/N) for each target, and determines fluence limits. I used
																																	seven energy bands ranging from 10-350 keV for S/N and 10-150 keV for fluence, 13 timescales from
																																	0.01 to 6 seconds and 6 spectrum models. I used a search window of 6 s around the FRB observation in
																																	radio wavelengths. S/N estimates were determined for 244 sources analyzed, no FRBs were detected.
																																	Fluence limits were determined for 49 FRBs at a level of ‚àº 10‚àí7
																																	ergs cm‚àí2
																																	in the 10-150 keV band (95%
																																	confidence). It is possible that nearby FRBs could be detected by Swift/BAT, and future research
																																	will focus on addressing issues that led to failures in the analysis of targets and analyzing a larger
																																	CHIME/FRB catalog.

																																		<b> Project Abstract: </b>The goals of this study were to improve our understanding of gravitational waves from magnetar giant flares, and to determine if third generation gravitational wave detectors will be able to detect magnetar giant flares. In order to test this, I implemented simplistic emission waveforms, using parameters based on the known magnetar giant flares. I then used these waveforms to estimate the signal-to-noise ratio for third generation detectors. My resulting highest signal-to-noise was $\sim 10^{-3}$ which is four orders of magnitude smaller then my detection threshold of 8, indicating that third generation detectors will be unable to detect magnetar giant flares.

																														<b> Project Description: </b>
																														The "Polarization Sky Survey of the Universe's
Magnetism" (POSSUM) is one of the eight major
surveys to be conducted by the Australian Square
Kilometer Array Pathfinder (ASKAP). POSSUM will
make a catalogue of Faraday rotation measures (RMs)
for around a million extragalactic radio sources ‚Äì that's
an increase of 20x the current known Faraday rotation
measures (RMs). The goal of this project was to
develop a robust error analysis of the POSSUM data as
a part of the POSSUM data pipeline. <br>The key result from this project was the discovery that
the output error bars from the pipeline are slightly
too small. If the error bars were the correct size, then
in the histogram below would match the Gaussian
distribution exactly. However, the normalized residual
is too wide for the Gaussian - this means the error
bars are too small. Having too small error bars for the
pipeline is a concern as future research will depend
on the accuracy of the errors. 	<br><br> <a href="files/robust_error_analysis.pptx" target="_blank"> POSSUM Presentation</a><p>

																								2022, submitted. <br> <br> <b> Project Abstract:</b> Measurements of the polarization of radio emission are subject to a number of depolarization effects such as bandwidth
depolarization, which is caused by the averaging effect of a finite channel bandwidth combined with the frequency-dependent
polarization caused by Faraday rotation. There have been very few mathematical treatments of bandwidth depolarization,
especially in the context of the rotation measure (RM) synthesis method for analyzing radio polarization data. We have found a
simple equation for predicting if bandwidth depolarization is significant for a given observational configuration. We have derived
and tested three methods of modifying RM synthesis to correct for bandwidth depolarization. From these tests we have developed
a new algorithm that can detect bandwidth-depolarized signals with higher signal-to-noise than conventional RM synthesis and
recover the correct source polarization properties (RM and polarized intensity). We have verified that this algorithm works as
expected with real data from the LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey. To make this algorithm available to the community, we have
added it as a new tool in the RM-Tools polarization analysis package. <br> <br>  <a href="files/rm_tools_poster.pdf" target="_blank"> End of SURP Poster</a><p>

																																		<p>Despite what some may say, I have a life outside of astronomy. My hobbies include reading, gardening,
																																			getting lost in the city or park, visiting muesems. I like to think I can bake (bread), and paint - I've been told its worse then my Karoke singing.



																																			<br> <br> Unfortunately, I am also an expert on
																																			antisemitism, and spoke at the <a href="https://neverisnow.org/" target="_blank"> 2022 Anti-Defamation League (<b>ADL</b>) confrence </a> Javits Center in NYC (photo above).
