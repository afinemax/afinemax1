								<b>About Me:</b>
								<br> Greetings and well wishes to all who may encounter this message! 
								<br><br>My name is Max Fine. I'm a graduate student studying Physics & Astrophysics (üì°üí´) at the University of Amsterdam. I earned my undergraduate degree from the University of Toronto (with Honors)  in Canada! I am originally from St. Augustine, Florida. I'm passionate about exploring the unknown, improving our understanding of the cosmos, and adding to the collective knowledge of humankind. I believe that science has the power to change the world and I'm eager to contribute to that change in any way I can.<br> 

								<br>I have a keen interest in radio astronomy and multimessenger astronomy. I am interested in scientific
								data processing with a potential inclination toward instrumentation.
								My background includes experience in algorithm development for radio astronomy, error testing a data
								analysis pipeline, and dedicated research in Fast Radio Burst (FRB) and multimessenger astronomy.
								Furthermore, I am interested in the application of machine learning in astrophysics. Additionally, my
								curiosity extends to exoplanets and astrobiology. I care deeply about science
								advocacy and believe that it‚Äôs essential to share the wonder and importance of science with the broader
								community. <br> <br>

								I am highly skilled in <code>Linux</code> and <code>Git</code>, 
								and I am fluent in <code>Python</code> programming, specializing in packages such as <code>Numpy</code>, 
								<code>Scipy</code>, <code>Matplotlib</code>, <code>Pytorch</code>, <code>Pandas</code>, <code>RM-TOOLS</code>, 
								and <code>Astropy</code>. I am skilled in data analysis, Bayesian analysis, time-series analysis, algorithm development, 
								and scientific computing. I have contributed significantly to the open-source scientific <code>Python</code> package <code>RM-TOOLS</code>, 
								resulting in a published scientific paper in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomy Society. I am additionally experienced in:  
								<code> C++</code>, <code>SQL</code>, <code>AWS</code>, <code>Kubernetes</code>, <code>Docker</code>, Cloud & Cluster Computing, and Big Data (>300 GB files).<br><br>


								While I currently live in the Netherlands, I hold dual citizenship in the USA and Canada, 
								which enables me to work & live in both countries.  As a UofT graduate, I additionally qualify 
								for the High Potential Individual visa (UK work visa).  
									
			

								<br><br> When I'm not studying the stars, you can often find me exploring cafes and searching for the perfect latte. If it is not raining, playing frisbee in a park.  
								I enjoy reading and tickering with Raspberry Pis. 

								<br><br> My dream is to live the adventurous life of a scientific researcher.
								I would like to earn a PhD related to astrophysics and serve in the Peace Corps teaching high school math and science for two years abroad.

																														<b> Project Abstract: </b>	<br> Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are brief radio pulses with unknown extragalactic origins. So far FRBs
																																	have only been detected at radio frequencies. Several FRB progenitor models propose that these bursts
																																	originate from magnetars, and predict associated Œ≥-ray emission. Previous Œ≥-ray searches have only
																																	examined two repeating FRB sources. This study used data from the Swift/BAT telescope which
																																	was obtained with GUANO to analyze 380 CHIME/FRB targets. I made an analysis pipeline that
																																	estimates the peak Signal-To-Noise Ratio (S/N) for each target, and determines fluence limits. I used
																																	seven energy bands ranging from 10-350 keV for S/N and 10-150 keV for fluence, 13 timescales from
																																	0.01 to 6 seconds and 6 spectrum models. I used a search window of 6 s around the FRB observation in
																																	radio wavelengths. S/N estimates were determined for 244 sources analyzed, no FRBs were detected.
																																	Fluence limits were determined for 49 FRBs at a level of ‚àº 10‚àí7
																																	ergs cm‚àí2
																																	in the 10-150 keV band (95%
																																	confidence). It is possible that nearby FRBs could be detected by Swift/BAT, and future research
																																	will focus on addressing issues that led to failures in the analysis of targets and analyzing a larger
																																	CHIME/FRB catalog.

I then used these waveforms to estimate the signal-to-noise ratio for third generation detectors. My resulting highest signal-to-noise was $\sim 10^{-3}$ which is four orders of magnitude smaller then my detection threshold of 8, indicating that third generation detectors will be unable to detect magnetar giant flares.

																														<b> Project Description: </b>
																														The "Polarization Sky Survey of the Universe's
Magnetism" (POSSUM) is one of the eight major
surveys to be conducted by the Australian Square
Kilometer Array Pathfinder (ASKAP). POSSUM will
make a catalogue of Faraday rotation measures (RMs)
for around a million extragalactic radio sources ‚Äì that's
an increase of 20x the current known Faraday rotation
measures (RMs). The goal of this project was to
develop a robust error analysis of the POSSUM data as
a part of the POSSUM data pipeline. <br>The key result from this project was the discovery that
the output error bars from the pipeline are slightly
too small. If the error bars were the correct size, then
in the histogram below would match the Gaussian
distribution exactly. However, the normalized residual
is too wide for the Gaussian - this means the error
bars are too small. Having too small error bars for the
pipeline is a concern as future research will depend
on the accuracy of the errors. 	<br><br> <a href="files/robust_error_analysis.pptx" target="_blank"> POSSUM Presentation</a><p>

																								2022, submitted. <br> <br> <b> Project Abstract:</b> Measurements of the polarization of radio emission are subject to a number of depolarization effects such as bandwidth
depolarization, which is caused by the averaging effect of a finite channel bandwidth combined with the frequency-dependent
polarization caused by Faraday rotation. There have been very few mathematical treatments of bandwidth depolarization,
especially in the context of the rotation measure (RM) synthesis method for analyzing radio polarization data. We have found a
simple equation for predicting if bandwidth depolarization is significant for a given observational configuration. We have derived
and tested three methods of modifying RM synthesis to correct for bandwidth depolarization. From these tests we have developed
a new algorithm that can detect bandwidth-depolarized signals with higher signal-to-noise than conventional RM synthesis and
recover the correct source polarization properties (RM and polarized intensity). We have verified that this algorithm works as
expected with real data from the LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey. To make this algorithm available to the community, we have
added it as a new tool in the RM-Tools polarization analysis package. <br> <br>  <a href="files/rm_tools_poster.pdf" target="_blank"> End of SURP Poster</a><p>

																																		I was one of the founding executives of the
																																		UofT Amateur Astronomers Society, where I helped organized star parties, field trips for meteor showers, and astronomy trivia nights. I
																																		was further involved with outreach as a volunteer with the monthly Astronomy UofT outreach events.
																																		Additionally, I was the physics director of my undergraduate student union, where I was both a volunteer
																																		at, and in charge of the physics tutoring center which offers free tutoring for first and second year physics
																																		classes.

																																		<p>Despite what some may say, I have a life outside of astronomy. My hobbies include reading, gardening,
																																			getting lost in the city or park, visiting muesems. I like to think I can bake (bread), and paint - I've been told its worse then my karaoke singing.



																																			<br> <br> Unfortunately, I am also an expert on
																																			antisemitism, and spoke at the <a href="https://neverisnow.org/" target="_blank"> 2022 Anti-Defamation League (<b>ADL</b>) confrence </a> Javits Center in NYC (photo above).
